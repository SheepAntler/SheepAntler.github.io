    <article id="ladyMondegreenBio">
    	<p>Lady Mondegreen is a well-known minstrel living and working in London. Originally from Orpington, Lady Mondegreen was raised by a humble miller in the country. Her mother died in childbirth, 
    	   which is why she bears her name: Ondine. Growing up without a mother was difficult; however, it taught Ondine how to be independent&mdash;knowledge that would later help her in her career as 
    	   a freelance musician working in the 16th century.</p>

    	<p>As a child, Ondine loved wandering the meadows, humming tunes she invented based on snippets of birdsong. While her father hoped that she would grow up to marry a local farmer or miller like 
    	   himself, he recognized her innate musical talent and did not attempt to dissuade her from pursuing music as a career. Instead of saving money for her dowry, Ondine's father purchased Ondine her first lute at age 9, and also helped her organize bi-annual trips to Kent in order to work with Thomas Tallis, a composer with whom you are all likely familiar.</p>

    	<p>Ondine chose her stage name, Lady Mondegreen, while en route to Kent one autumn morning. She was contemplating the high hopes her father had had for her adult life, and how willing he had been 
    	   to lay them aside for her happiness and fulfillment as an artist. Deeming her life-path as a musician far preferable to a life as the wife of a farmer, she adopted the title &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; 
    	   to reflect the status she felt she held as an individual, regardless of society's estimation. She then concocted the name &ldquo;Mondegreen&rdquo;&mdash;a combination of the French word 
    	   &ldquo;<i>Monde</i>&rdquo;, meaning <i>World</i>, and of course the color green&mdash;a color which reminds Ondine of the green fields of her childhood. The <i>monde</i> portion of the name 
    	   signifies Ondine's wanderlust&mdash;never content to stay in one place, Ondine prefers life on the road, traveling from town to town in search of her next performance venue.</p>

    	<p>While being a female minstrel in the 1500s is not an easy path, Ondine has risen to the challenge with courage and determination, and it was not long before her magnetic passion for her art soon 
    	   attracted a consort of skilled instrumentalists: the Eggcorns who travel and perform with Lady Mondegreen today. If you would like to learn more about the Eggcorn Consort, please
