     <article class="eggcornConsortInfo">
        <p>For several months after moving to London, Lady Mondegreen mostly performed alone. A proficient <span class="vocabulary" 
           title="Someone who plays the lute, a plucked string instrument with a rounded back.">lutenist</span>, she
           was able to handle solo gigs quite well, but always felt that something was missing. Occasionally, she would
           be asked to sit in with travelling <span class="vocabulary" title="The 16th/17th Century term for &rdquo;ensemble&ldquo;">consorts</span> as a lutenist or backup vocalist, 
           and those experiences always left
           her feeling envious of those well-established ensembles. However, one night on her way home from a tavern where
           she'd been performing, she ran into two childhood friends of hers: Philippa and Lettice Godfrey.</p>

        <p>The three women had spent many happy days playing music together in their youths, and quickly picked up right where they
           left off. That very evening, Lady Mondegreen accompanied the Godfreys back to their living quarters, and the three of them
           spent the entire night singing standard <span class="vocabulary" title="A part-song for several voices, typically arranged in elaborate counterpoint without instrumental accompaniment."> 
           madrigals</span>. Lady Mondegreen was blown away by what accomplished lutenists
           both Philippa and Lettice had become, and she immediately asked whether they would be interested in performing with her
           as her own foundling consort.</p>

     <article class="eggcornConsortInfo">
        <p>Philippa and Lettice, excited to be founding members of a new ensemble, jumped at the chance. As well-connected instrumentalists, they helped Lady Mondegreen
           cobble together an increasingly large consort. First, they added Geoffrey Wolfden on <span class="vocabulary" 
           title="The lowest pitched string instrument in the viola da gamba family. Ancestor of the modern cello.">bass&nbsp;viol</span>. Soon afterwards, Piers Moland 
           joined the group on <span class="vocabulary" title="The highest pitched string instrument in the viola da gamba family. Ancestor of the modern violin.">soprano&nbsp;viol</span>. Geoffrey and Piers invited their friends Thomasine Ginter and Diggory Good, who play 
           <span class="vocabulary" title="A woodwind instrument from the Renaissance.">crumhorn</span> and <span class="vocabulary" title="The trombone of the Renaissance.">sackbut</span>, respectively. After hearing the ensemble live, both wholeheartedly agreed to join.</p> 

        <p>At long last, the group found a suitable percussionist. Lambert &rdquo;Lam&ldquo; Sparrow joined the consort along with his wife, Sabine, a wonderful flute and recorder player. At that point, 
           everyone in the ensemble agreed that the project felt complete. Many of the musicians listed above are veritable instrumental chameleons who play secondary and even tertiary instruments as well, so it's almost as if we have nearly double the number of musicians we appear to have! Now, Lady Mondegreen and her Eggcorns enjoy a lively touring life, traveling all over the country to various estates, castles, and faires, performing songs they grew up with, songs they wrote themselves, and everything in-between.</p>
