        <p>Elspeth Stalter-Clouse is a firm believer in the addage, "Idle hands are the Devil's playthings." Ever since she was a
           child growing up in the bustling metropolis of New York City in the United States, she has kept her fingers busy.
           She began her artistic career using the humble medium of Play-Dough, creating tiny coil-pots and sculptures of animals just
           to see what sorts of shapes she could create. As she grew older, her interests expanded and she began to investigate other materials,
           needle-felting and knitting wool and selling the resulting hats, mittens, and ornaments at craft fairs all over the East Coast.</p>
        <p>When Elspeth was in primary school, her parents noticed her natural skill with paints and bought her a nice set of oil paints
           for Christmas one year. At first, Elspeth enjoyed painting portraits of her stuffed animals, until the fateful year that she
           received a Matroyshka Doll for her birthday, a gift from her aunt and uncle who had recently visited Prague.
           Albeit a somewhat clich&eacute; gift from the Czech Republic, the doll sparked in Elspeth a wave of creativity. The detailed floral
           patterns of the doll and the increasing level of fine motor skill required to decorate each smaller doll nested inside its larger counterpart
           intrigued her, and she began trying out some designs of her own.</p>
        <p>After grauduating from high school, Elspeth majored in art at the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the most prestigious
           art schools in North America. While there, she researched Czechian folk art and finally, after her four years of study, got a grant to
           visit the Czech Republic herself and study art there.</p>
        <p>Now, she works with a colleague to create the legendary Czech nesting dolls herself at her specialty shop, Matroyshka Mania. When she isn't 
           in the studio, she can be found performing chamber music throughout Prague with her string quartet, <i>Con Vivo</i>.</p>
