        <h2>Who Can Be a Friend? Everyone!</h2>
          <p>
          Anyone can become a Friend of Arte Del Mundo, and help this worthy enterprise
          to grow and prosper. You don't have to know anything about art. In fact, one
          of the benefits of becoming a friend is that you can learn about various kinds of
          art, and how the artists create their works. See the benefits list below.
