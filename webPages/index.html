  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

     <article>
        <p>
        Arte Del Mundo&reg; is a non-profit service that allows individual local
        artists and crafts persons around the world to be able to market their products
        directly to a global audience. These fine products are handcrafted and are
        of the highest quality. You avoid the high markup costs of retail stores
        when you purchase directly from the artist that produces the goods. Note
        that this website is informational only. All sales are made directly via
        the artists themselves. We're here to facilitate and inform. </p>
        <p>
        Arte Del Mundo people are in two general categories.
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>First and foremost are the artists themselves, known as Member Artists.</li>
            <li>Secondly, there is a large group of important people, people who like to help
            Arte Del Mundo grow and prosper. These are officially Friends of Arte Del
            Mundo (more about Friends <a href="friendsInfo.html">here</a>.) Please
            consider becoming a Friend.</li>
