    <article id="godfreysBio">
    	<p>Philippa and Lettice Godfrey have been performing with Lady Mondegreen since the beginning. She and her sister Lettice grew up on a farm bordered by Lady Mondegreen's family mill, and 
     	   their fathers worked together often. As children, Philippa, Lettice, and Ondine would often traipse about the countryside, singing songs together.</p>

     	<p>Philippa is an accomplished lutenist, and has played the lute since she was only 7 years of age. Her uncle, who lived in London, bought her a lute for her seventh birthday and paid for her
     	   to take a few lessons in the city. She would stay with him for a weekend once every month in order to recieve instruction, and she practiced tirelessly in the interim periods. Her love of
     	   music was great, and she took great joy in being able to train her muscles and mind to perform increasingly-complex passagework.</p>

     	<p>Her younger sister, Lettice, grew up watching her sister play and soon wanted a lute of her own. Ever since, they have been inseparable compatriots in life and in art, performing together 
     	   as a duo and with various consorts throughout the country.</p>

     	<p>When they ran into Lady Mondegreen in London on separate gigs one night, they re-kindled their old friendship and &rdquo;Lady Mondegreen&ldquo; became &rdquo;Lady Mondegreen and the 
     	   Eggcorns.&ldquo; Since then, Lady Mondegreen has relied heavily upon Philippa and Lettice's instrumental connections to continue to build her ever-growing consort of Eggcorns.</p>

     	<p>While they still perform as a duo throughout the British Isles, the Godfrey sisters love performing with Lady Mondegreen and the Eggcorns, and both agree that it is an empowering 
     	   experience for both of them to be in an ensemble lead by a woman in a musical environment in which women are typically scarce.</p>
