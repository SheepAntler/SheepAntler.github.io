      <p>New to Lady Mondegreen and the Eggcorns? Interested in our work but unsure where to start? We get it. It's hard to just jump into a new band's sound without having a 
         guide to help you. That's why we built our <i>Listen</i> page. Below, you'll find images and descriptions of four albums from our collection. We've chosen these four albums
         as a representative sampling of our work. Then, from each album, we've selected a track that we think you will enjoy. We have it all&mdash;from contemplative vocal numbers 
         to dance&ndash;worthy instrumental improvisatory tunes, we're sure you'll find something here that intrigues you.</p>

      <p>If you like what you hear, feel free to head over to our <a href="merchandise.html">shop</a> to purchase an entire album or check out our <a href="events.html">upcoming live events</a>
         if you'd like to see us in action.</p>

      <p><i>Sapling</i> was our first album. We recorded it just three months after we'd all played together, and of all our albums, it's probably the safest. It's chock full of 
         Big Hits; lots of popular madrigals and instrumental dances can be found on this album. We learned a lot about one another throughout the recording process; we 
         could only afford five days in the studio, so we were forced to handle that stress together and we all impressed one another in terms of our efficiency and 
         level-headedness as a relatively new ensemble in a highly pressurized situation. We were veteran performers as individuals, but we were inexperienced as a consort 
         together, so we chose the album name, <i>Sapling</i>, to reflect this.</p>

      <p>The track we've selected for you to preview here, <i>Zefiro Torna</i> by Claudio Monteverdi, is a favorite of ours. It's a jaunty tune featuring our lutenists, 
         percussionist, flautist, viol players, and vocalists, and we think it really hightlights what we have to offer as a band. It's also a good reminder to us that 
         no matter how humble we felt at the beginning, we still had a lot to be grateful for in our early days.</p>

        <p>Our second album, <i>Roots</i>, is a celebration of how far music has come. After our first album, in which we tried to highlight the entire consort as much as possible, we 
           decided to really pare things down. This album is simple, hearkening back to a less bombastic style of performance. We chose the title as an homage to our musical forbears, to 
           a time when there were less instruments to choose from and simpler musical styles to enjoy. This album is much more intimate than our first; we normally perform the tracks from 
           this album when we play concerts in our patrons' parlors and sitting rooms instead of their banquet halls.</p>

        <p>We selected the track <i>Paavin</i> by Domenico Alberti as our featured track for <i>Roots</i> because we feel it truly captures the vibe of this recording as a whole. It is a 
           repetitive and simple track, starting with a single lute, then adding recorder, viol, and some percussion as the track progresses. We wanted to select a track that both highlighted 
           the difference between this album and our first while still featuring the vast capabilities of our ensemble.</p>

          <p>When we recorded <i>Menagerie</i>, we'd had the desire to record a themed album for about a year. Almost as if heeded by the cosmos, that year we were introduced to a whole slough
             of songs about animals. It was our soprano viol player, Piers Moland, who first pointed this out, and soon afterwards we booked a studio to record our newfound repertoire as 
             a collection. <i>Menagerie</i> is a varied album&mdash;as varied as the animal kingdom itself. In it, we have songs about both the humblest and noblest of beasts. It was very difficult for
             us to choose a favorite track, but at long last, we did.</p> 

          <p><i>Il bianco e dolce cigno</i> is a beautiful song for four voices, with no instrumental accompaniment. This piece is a setting of a poem to music, with words by Marquis Alfonso d'Avalos and 
                music by Jacques Arcadelt. After it was published, it became quite a favorite in society; if you haven't heard us perform it before, we would be surprised if you hadn't heard it before! However, if it's managed to escape you thus far, we envy you the experience of hearing it for the first time. We feel so fortunate to have such wonderful instrumentalists in our number, and even luckier that each and every one of them is also a fabulous singer to boot! This track highlights the multiple talents of our performers, and is such a beautiful representation of 
                how even the simplest pieces can be transporting.</p>

          <p><i>Equinox</i> is our latest album to date. We released it in autumn, just before the autumnal equinox. This is a special time of year for us as it marks the season during which we started 
             working together as a consort. We announced our official presence just after the autumnal equinox just a few short years ago, and since then we've come so far. It was fun for us to record this
             album and reminisce on our first album together as an ensemble. Even though we were able to afford more than five days in the studio this go&ndash;around, it only took us five to record. This 
             was especially meaningful for us, as it showed us how much more efficient we've become as a group. The cogs of our machine are running so much more smoothly now than they were at the start, and it is rare for artists to see evidence of this.</p>

          <p>We chose a cheerful tune for you this time. <i>Spagnoletta</i> by Michael Praetorius is a dance number, one of our most frequent requests at wedding feasts and post-banquet dances. We feature 
             three of our instrumentalists here: Lam Sparrow on percussion, Piers Moland on viol, Diggory Good on the guitar (an instrument he's not often seen playing!), and Thomasine Ginter on recorder.
             During this track, you will get to hear our skilled musicians improvise on a relatively simple theme, taking a well-known standard and making it their own. This is a difficult practice that 
             requires not only innate knowledge of your instrument, but also great knowledge of music theory as well. When people listen to music, they often enjoy what they are hearing so much they do not
             think about the level of technical skill and knowledge required by the performers. We find it amusing that works such as this, while scintillating and diverting, require such hard work from the musicians. Truly, this track encapsulates the paradox of performing.
