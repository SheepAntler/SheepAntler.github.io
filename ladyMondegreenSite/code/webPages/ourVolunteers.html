      <p>This page is dedicated to our heroes. We would not be able to do the work we do, or make the art we make, without the generous support of our indispensible 
         nonmusical Eggcorns&mdash;our wonderful patrons. To be a musician is no easy road, yet it is a difficult path that artists cannot turn away from. Therefore, 
         it means more to us than we can say to have such a supportive team of Eggcorns investing in our sound, our endeavours and our dreams.</p>

      <p>We have had the privilege to get to know all of our patrons quite well at the annual house concerts we offer to each of them, and we love each and every one of them
         dearly. We've watched their households grow, and we've enjoyed performing at their weddings, their children's weddings, their banquets, and their hunts. We've also greatly
         enjoyed watching their musical tastes shift over the years. The musical requests we receive from them have pushed us to be better, more knowledgable musicians.</p>

      <p>Our patrons come to our live shows in London when they're in town, and it's always such a pleasure to see them. We often go out for drinks with them afterwards to get a chance to 
         catch up, and we love listening to their stories about their ever&ndash;interesting lives. Our patrons are so diverse&mdash;they are travellers, scholars, and art collectors. 
         They are also parents, soldiers, clergy, and businesspeople.</p>  

      <p>We feel so honored to constantly add new patrons to our Eggcorn Family; in a world like this it's always better to have more friends than less. We cannot wait to meet our next 
         Eggcorn, and we would love to meet with you if you are interested in joining us. You can find a link to the Patronage Form below.</p>

      <p>And for those of you who have been part of our Family of Eggcorns for a long time, there are no words to accurately express our gratitude. Our only hope is that we have managed to 
         make your worlds a little bigger, and your thoughts a little deeper. Each and every one of you enriches our lives as performers, artists, and people every day, in big and small ways. 
         If we are able to give back to you even a fraction of what you give us, we will feel like our lives are lives lived well.</p>
