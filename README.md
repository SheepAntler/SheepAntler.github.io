Just a bit of the work I've done during my studies at Madison College! 
Here are the skills/technologies/processes that I used for each project: 

* [Lady Mondegreen and the Eggcorns band website](ladyMondegreenSite) (HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
* [Mad Libs Game](madLibs) (PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS)
* [Couch Potato Fitness Tracker](couchPotatoFitness) (PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS)
* [Night Thinker Blog](nightThinkerBlog) (PHP, SQL, Bootstrap)
* [100 Days of Practice Application](100DaysOfPractice) (PHP, SQL, Bootstrap)
* [Arte Del Mundo site redesign](arteDelMundoRedesign) (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, user research, color theory)
* [Wisco Explore! site redesign](wiscoExploreRedesign) (Wireframes/Mockups, user research, color theory)

In each folder, you will find screenshots of my various applications running/my site designs. 
There are even video walkthroughs here and there!
