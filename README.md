Here you will find some of the work I've done in my studies at Madison College. I've uploaded some of my code, of course,
but what will likely be more interesting to many of you are the folders containing screenshots and video walkthroughs 
of the applications I have built in the past two years. 

* ladyMondegreenSite (HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
* madLibs (PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS)
* couchPotatoFitness (PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS)
* nightThinkerBlog (PHP, SQL, Bootstrap)
* 100DaysOfPractice (PHP, SQL, Bootstrap)
