Just a bit of the work I've done during my studies at Madison College! 
Here are the skills/technologies/processes that I used for each project: 

* [ladyMondegreenSite](ladyMondegreenSite) (HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
* madLibs (PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS)
* couchPotatoFitness (PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS)
* nightThinkerBlog (PHP, SQL, Bootstrap)
* 100DaysOfPractice (PHP, SQL, Bootstrap)
* arteDelMundoRedesign (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, user research, color theory)
* wiscoExploreRedesign (Wireframes/Mockups, user research, color theory)

In each folder, you will find screenshots of my various applications running/my site designs. 
There are even video walkthroughs here and there!
